# MGSFPSUnlock
This is an experimental mod that allows you to play Metal Gear Solid 3 at framerates above (and below) 60. This mod is a work in progress so you should expect there to be issues.

## How to use

1. Download `MGSFPSUnlock.zip` from the [releases](https://github.com/cipherxof/MGSFPSUnlock/releases) page
2. Extract to your MGS3 install location (i.e `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MGS3`)
3. Edit `MGSFPSUnlock.ini` and choose your target framerate.
